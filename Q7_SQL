/* Q7)Explain a use case where you would use a self join */
What is self join?
As the name suggests its a join established inside a same table similar to a self loop.
Use case for self join:
Incase if a HR team wants to map its employee with the manager name where in the base table they have manager id(same as employee id) associated with the each employee.
Under this scenario,let's assume there are some null values in the managerID as the team has to recruit new managers for some employees.
Table Structure:
Table Name:Employee
Columns:ID,EmployeeName,ManagerID
Desired output mapping:
Columns:EmployeeID,EmployeeName,ManagerName
Query:
SELECT e.ID as EmployeeID,e.EmployeeName as EmployeeName,m.EmployeeName as ManagerName
from Employee e
left join Employee m
on e.ID=m.ID
